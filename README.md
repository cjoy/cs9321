# COMP9321 - Data Services Engineering
# Assignments
##  [Assignment 1](https://github.com/mrchrisjoy/cs9321/tree/master/ass1)
The assignment data was extracted from the Wikipedia entry on All Time Olympic Games Medals , with some minor modification to make things interesting. The dataset is split into two CSV files one of summer games and the other for the winter games and combined total.

Use the datasets to answer the following questions. Create a python function for each of questions, then in the main method, print the question names and then the outputs of functions. (15/15)


## [Assignment 2](https://github.com/mrchrisjoy/cs9321/tree/master/ass2)
In this assignment, you are asked to develop a Flask-Restplus data service that allows a client to read and store some publicly available economic indicator data for countries around the world, and allow the consumers to access the data through a REST API. (15/15)


## [Project](https://github.com/movie-base)
In this assignment, you are asked to develop a Data Analytics Service . Besides a few requirements that you must meet, the specification of the service you'd build is deliberately left open. (29/30)

# [Labs](https://github.com/mrchrisjoy/cs9321/tree/master/labs)
I've only done the first five labs. Most of my time was spend working the assignments / projects.
